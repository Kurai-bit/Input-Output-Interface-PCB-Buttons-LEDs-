# Input-Output Interface PCB (Buttons + LEDs) 

## Setup
Create branch.
Use 4–8 push buttons and 8–16 LEDs arranged in matrix.

## Goal: Build a simple I/O board for learning matrix scanning.

## Tasks
Create schematic with rows/columns for buttons and LEDs.
Use resistor arrays or individual resistors.
Include connector for microcontroller interface.
Test scanning with Arduino sketch.
Document button debounce and LED drive logic.

## Submit: All files, test code, schematic, PCB layout, matrix map in report.
## Estimated time: 2 weeks
